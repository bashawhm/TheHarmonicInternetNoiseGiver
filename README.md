To run the server go to the server directory and run: 
`go run server.go`

This will serve the contents of the client diectory and run the
THING server on port 80, note this may require sudo as it is a
reserved port. 

Once this is done connect to the machine from a web browser (ideally
Mozilla FireFox or Google Chrome) and you will be prompted with the
THING client.
