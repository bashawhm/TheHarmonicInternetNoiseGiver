THING Control Protocol	v1.0
RFC Work in Progress
============================

All fields must be one word in length unless otherwise specified.

1	Establishing A Connection

	When a THING client connects to the server it will send the
	following commands:

	LOBBY

		This command can be sent by the client to query the lobbies on the
		server. This will be responded to with the list of lobby names followed
		by an OKAY.

	CREATE <lobby name> <username>

		The lobby with <lobby name> will be created and the client will become
		the administrator. If the lobby name is taken the following will be
		sent followed by an OKAY:

	<lobby name> TAKEN

	JOIN <lobby name> <username>

		Usernames and lobby names must be all one word!

		This will cause the server to add this user (with this username)
		to the lobby of that name.

		If the Username is taken the server will send the following to the
		client followed by an OKAY:

	<username> TAKEN

	OKAY

		Once this passes the server will have recorded the client into the
		lobby and is ready to serve requests.

2	Server Commands

	PLAY <song title>

		The PLAY command will be sent when the admin wishes to begin song playback.
		When the client recieves this command they will imediatly begin playback
		of the song named <song title>.

	PAUSE

		The PAUSE command will be sent by the server whn the admin wishes to halt
		the playback of the currently playing audio. When received the client will
		imediatly halt all audio playback.

	NOTIFY <message>

		The NOTIFY command is used to send notifications to their respective
		clients. When an administrator or moderator gets a notification the
		server will send the notification in the message field of this command.
		The <message> can be of any length.

	UPDATE <song title> <artist> <tag1> <tag2>

		The UPDATE command is used to inform the clients of changes to the meta
		data of the song that has the title <song title>.

	PIMG

		The PING command is used for the server to moniter the network round
		trip time for each individual client. When the server sends out a PING
		packet, the client will then respond with an OKAY. This delay/round trip
		time will then be used to synchronize the audio playback.

	SEND <title> <artist> <tag1> <tag2>

		The SEND command is used by the server to indicate to the client
		that it is about to begin a file transfer over the WebRTC audio
		channel of an audio file named <title>. The following fields are
		optional: <artist>, <tag1>, <tag2>. 

		The SEND command is imediatly followed by a series of <=1000 byte
		"Chunks" of an audio file for reassembly on the client side. This
		Will be followed by the usual OKAY command which should signal to
		client to reassemble the file and store it in cache.

	OKAY

		The OKAY command is used by the server to tell the client that the
		server is done with its current job and is in a good state, ready
		to accept commands.

3	Administrator Commands

	PLAY <song title>

		The admin sends this command to the server to begin playing the song
		named <song title>. Note, the admin will wait until it receives the PLAY
		command back from the server to begin playing. Sending this command alone
		is not enough to begin playback on the admin device. This command will be 
		responded to with the OKAY command.

	PAUSE

		The admin sends this command to the server to halt the audio playback. 
		The server will respond to this with the OKAY command. The Client will
		not pause playback upon sending this command, it will wait until the server
		sends the PAUSE command back to the client.

	ACCEPT <username>

		The ACCEPT command tell the server to accept the potential users join
		request and let them into the lobby. The server will respond to this with
		and OKAY.

	SONG <title> SET

		The SONG command on its own is invalid, but has a series of sub-commands
		all of which will be followed by an OKAY from the server.

		TAG1

			If the Admin client sends:

			SONG <title> SET TAG1 <tag>

			Then the song named <title> will have its tag1 field set to <tag>

		TAG2

			If the Admin client sends:

			SONG <title> SET TAG2 <tag>

			Then the song named <title> will have its tag2 field set to <tag>

		ARTIST

			If the Admin client sends:

			SONG <title> SET ARTIST <artist>

			Then the song named <title> will have its artist field set to <artist>

	SEND <title> <artist> <tag1> <tag2>

		The SEND command from the administrator is very much the same as the
		SEND command from the server, it indicates that the client wishes to
		upload a song named <title> for distrobution. The following fields are
		optional: <artist>, <tag1>, <tag2>. This will be followed by a series
		of <=1000 byte "Chunks" of an audio file. The client will follow the 
		data transfer with an OKAY, to signal to the server that it's done sending.

	OKAY

		The OKAY is used by the client to tell the server that the client is
		done with its current job and is in a good state, ready to accept 
		commands. OKAY is also a valid responce to a PING from the server.

4	Moderator Commands

	ACCEPT <username>

		The ACCEPT command tell the server to accept the potential users join
		request and let them into the lobby. This will be responded to with OKAY.

	OKAY

		The OKAY is used by the client to tell the server that the client is
		done with its current job and is in a good state, ready to accept 
		commands. OKAY is also a valid responce to a PING from the server.

5	User Commands

	OKAY

		The OKAY is used by the client to tell the server that the client is
		done with its current job and is in a good state, ready to accept 
		commands. OKAY is also a valid responce to a PING from the server.
