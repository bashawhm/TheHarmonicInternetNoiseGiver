============================

When a THING client connects to the server it will send the
following command:

<lobby name> <username>

Usernames and lobby names must be all one word!

to the lobby of that name and more so if that lobby doesn't exist,
it will be created. If the server creates a lobby this client will
become the Administrator. If the Username is taken the server will 
send the following to the client and reject the connection:

<username> TAKEN

If the server accepts the username it will send back the following:
