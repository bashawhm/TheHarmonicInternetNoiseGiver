============================

1	Estabolishing A Connection

	When a THING client connects to the server it will send the
	following commands:

	<lobby name> <username>

		Usernames and lobby names must be all one word!

		This will cause the server to add this user (with this username)
		to the lobby of that name and more so if that lobby doesn't exist,
		it will be created. If the server creates a lobby this client will
		become the Administrator. 
		
		If the Username is taken the server will send the following to the
		client and terminate the connection:

	<username> TAKEN

		If the server accepts the username it will send back the following:

	OKAY

		Once this passes the server will have recorded the client into the
		lobby and is ready to serve requests.

2	Server Commands

	SEND <title> <artist> <tag1> <tag2>

		The SEND command is used by the server to indicate to the client
		that it is about to begin a file transfer over the WebRTC audio
		channel of an audio file named <title>. The following fields are
		optional: <artist>, <tag1>, <tag2>. 

		The SEND command is imediatly followed by a series of <=1000 byte
		"Chunks" of an audio file for reassembly on the client side. This
		Will be followed by the usual OKAY command which should signal to
		client to reassemble the file and store it in cache.

	OKAY

		The OKAY command is used by the server to tell the client that the
		server is done with its current job and is in a good state, ready
		to accept commands.

3	Administrator Commands

	ACCEPT <username>

		The ACCEPT command tell the server to accept the potential users join
		request and let them into the lobby.

	SONG <title> SET

		The SONG command on its own is invalid, but has a series of sub-commands

		TAG1

			If the Admin client sends:

			SONG <title> SET TAG1 <tag>

			Then the song named <title> will have its tag1 field set to <tag>

		TAG2

			If the Admin client sends:

			SONG <title> SET TAG2 <tag>

			Then the song named <title> will have its tag2 field set to <tag>

		ARTIST <artist>

			If the Admin client sends:

			SONG <title> SET ARTIST <artist>

			Then the song named <title> will have its artist field set to <artist>

	SEND <title> <artist> <tag1> <tag2>

		The SEND command from the administrator is very much the same as the
		SEND command from the server, it indicates that the client wishes to
		upload a song named <title> for distrobution. The following fields are
		optional: <artist>, <tag1>, <tag2>. This will be followed by a series
		of <=1000 byte "Chunks" of an audio file.

	OKAY

		The OKAY is used by the client to tell the server that the client is
		done with its current job and is in a good state, ready to accept 
		commands.

4	Moderator Commands

	ACCEPT <username>

		The ACCEPT command tell the server to accept the potential users join
		request and let them into the lobby.
